Finshed my assignement for first ourse.
Following are the steps required for completing the assignement

1- Go create a folder where you will work on your assignment on your local PC
2- You need to connect this folder to your remote repo so write git remote add <alias> <link to github>. Link to github would be the repo you already created. Do note there is no need to make markdownfile when creating repo at github
3- git remote can be used to check status of the remote repo
4- Pull the remote repo to your local repo by typing git pull <alias> master
5- Next create a file called HelloWorld.md by typing git touch HelloWorld.md
6- type echo "## This is a markdown file" >> HelloWorld.md to type the content in your newly created markdownfile
7 - Next push this to remote repo by typing git push -u <alias> master. At this point it will ask for your credentials to enure that the right person is pushing the right conent

your done.
