# JourneytoDatascience
Step-by-step becoming a Data Scientist. I have no programing experince or remotely assosiated with computer/software.
I have Bsc. in Econmics but I enjoy data and fiding trend and batter - so decided to actually try and become a data scientist (if possible).

Finshed my assignement for first ourse.
Following are the steps required for completing the assignement

1- Go create a folder where you will work on your assignment on your local PC
2- You need to connect this folder to your remote repo so write git remote add <alias> <link to github>. Link to github would be the repo you already created. Do note there is no need to make markdownfile when creating repo at github
3- git remote can be used to check status of the remote repo
4- Pull the remote repo to your local repo by typing git pull <alias> master
5- Next create a file called HelloWorld.md by typing git touch HelloWorld.md
6- type echo "## This is a markdown file" >> HelloWorld.md to type the content in your newly created markdownfile
7 - Next push this to remote repo by typing git push -u <alias> master. At this point it will ask for your credentials to enure that the right person is pushing the right conent

your done.

Started Code School to learn more about Git & finished the first part out of 4.

#23rd October 2015
My first course is almost finished.I just neeed to review other people's assignment.
This course doesnt really teach anything and if i had a choice I would had skipped it.
The only thing which is new is github and working with remote repository. The datascience course itself wasnt really great.
Using Code School ought to help one out regarding whats happening. Make sure you understand each step before proceeding.
I could try and learn more of github but since I have no project to collaborate with - I am going to stick with basics for now.
